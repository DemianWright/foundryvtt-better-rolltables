*better-rolltables* is Module for FoundryVTT to improve and add functionality to Rollable tables
Implementing for example the Treasure Hoard" Tables from the Dungeon master manual becomes possible!

## NOTES ABOUT UPDATE FROM 18.95 for FVTT 9 to 1.9.1 FVTT 10

The form was updated for the 10 by on commission [elizeuangelo](https://github.com/elizeuangelo) and then perfected by [sasquach45932](https://github.com/sasquach45932) with some updates and bug fixing . Finallu [p4535992](https://github.com/p4535992) applied some code best practices (module id as prefix of i18n and css rules, etc.) and taking over maintenance of the module.

A special ty to the original authors [Ultrakorne#6240](https://ultrakorne.github.io/discord) and [DanielBÃ¶ttner](https://github.com/DanielBoettner).

## NOTE: This module is under maintenance, I have no plans to update or add features. However, I will try to fix any bugs as possible. Any contribution is welcome.

## Api

# Build

## Install all packages

```bash
npm install
```
## npm build scripts

### build

will build the code and copy all necessary assets into the dist folder and make a symlink to install the result into your foundry data; create a
`foundryconfig.json` file with your Foundry Data path.

```json
{
  "dataPath": "~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/"
}
```

`build` will build and set up a symlink between `dist` and your `dataPath`.

```bash
npm run-script build
```

### NOTE:

You don't need to build the `foundryconfig.json` file you can just copy the content of the `dist` folder on the module folder under `modules` of Foundry

### build:watch

`build:watch` will build and watch for changes, rebuilding automatically.

```bash
npm run-script build:watch
```

### clean

`clean` will remove all contents in the dist folder (but keeps the link from build:install).

```bash
npm run-script clean
```
### lint and lintfix

`lint` launch the eslint process based on the configuration [here](./.eslintrc)

```bash
npm run-script lint
```

`lintfix` launch the eslint process with the fix argument

```bash
npm run-script lintfix
```

### prettier-format

`prettier-format` launch the prettier plugin based on the configuration [here](./.prettierrc)

```bash
npm run-script prettier-format
```

### package

`package` generates a zip file containing the contents of the dist folder generated previously with the `build` command. Useful for those who want to manually load the module or want to create their own release

```bash
npm run-script package
```
